Integration of PhotoSwipe (http://photoswipe.com) for WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin is a simple integration of PhotoSwipe to WordPress. All linked images in a post or page will be displayed using PhotoSwipe, regardless if they are part of a gallery or single images. Just make sure that you link the image or gallery directly to the media and not the attachment page (in galleries the option `link=file` should be set).

More about PhotoSwipe see here: [http://photoswipe.com](http://photoswipe.com)

The version of PhotoSwipe provided with this plugin comes with a number of modifications and extensions. See the FAQ for details.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Using the plugin =

All linked images in a post or page will be displayed using PhotoSwipe, regardless if they are part of a gallery or single images.

Make sure that you link the image or gallery directly to the media and not the attachment page (in galleries the option `link=file` should be set).

If you want to display an image in it's own lightbox which does not display other images from the same post or page, you can add the attribute `data-gallery-id` to the link element with a unique value for this image. This value must not be a number since numbers are already used internally. For example you could the file name of the image like this:

`<a href="myimage.jpg" data-gallery-id="myimage.jpg"><img src="myimage-300x300.jpg" alt="My Image" /></a>`

You can also add the same `data-gallery-id` attribute to multiple single images to combine them in the same lightbox.

= Experimental feature: return to a specific URL when closing the lightbox =

Note: this was changed with version 2.0. The previous parameter `return` is no longer supported.

When you activate the setting for "Activate browser history" you can link directly to an image inside a page or post:

`http://domain.example/example-page#gid=1&pid=1`

This will load the given page/post and automatically open the first image (`pid=1`) in the lightbox. However, when closing the lightbox, you will see the page or post itself. Sometimes it is preferred to go to a specific URL when closing the lightbox. This can be done by using `returnurl` combined with the URL to got to as the first parameter:

`http://domain.example/example-page#returnurl=http://domain.example&gid=1&pid=1`

When a visitor now opens the link, closing the lightbox will get the visitor to specified URL `http://domain.example`.

= The plugin seems not to work properly =

Some themes or plugins have their own lightbox implementation which can cause a conflict with Lightbox with PhotoSwipe. In this case you need to disable the lightbox of the theme or other plugins if possible.

Also keep in mind that images need to be part of the HTML output generated by WordPress. Images which are added using JavaScript after the page has been loaded already by the browser cannot be displayed with Lightbox with PhotoSwipe.

= How to disable the plugin in certain pages/posts =

Please note: the order of the parameters have changed in version 1.90.

Some other plugins use PhotoSwipe as well and it may be neccessary to disable Lightbox with PhotoSwipe on some pages or posts - for example on the product pages of WooCommerce.

You can either configure the pages/posts manually in the settings or you can use the filter `lbwps_enabled`. This filter gets the ID of the current page/post and if the lightbox is currently enabled (`true` or `false`). If the filter returns `true`, the lightbox will be used, if it returns `false` the lightbox will be disabled - which means, no scripts and stylesheets will be included at all on the current page/post.

Example:

`
// Disable Lightbox with PhotoSwipe on WooCommerce product pages

function my_lbwps_enabled($enabled, $id)
{
    if (function_exists('is_product')) {
        if (is_product()) return false;
    }

    return $enabled;
}

add_filter('lbwps_enabled', 'my_lbwps_enabled', 10, 2);
`

= How to modify the PhotoSwipe markup =

If you want to modify the existing PhotoSwipe markup, you can use the filter `lbwps_markup`. This filter gets one parameter with the existing markup and must return the modified markup to be used.

A "quick & dirty" example to add additional stuff in the header with the controls (CSS should never be inline - this is just to get a working example):

`function my_lbwps_markup($markup)
{
    // Add some additional elements
    $markup = str_replace(
        '<div class="pswp__top-bar">',
        '<div class="pswp__top-bar"><div style="position:absolute; width:100%; text-align:center; line-height:44px; font-size:13px; color:#fff; opacity: 0.75;">Our content</div>',
        $markup
	);
    return $markup;
}

add_filter('lbwps_markup', 'my_lbwps_markup', 10, 1);`

= How to style the caption below the images =

If you want to style the caption below the images, you need to create custom styles for the following CSS classes:

pswp__caption - this class is used for the whole caption area.

pswp__caption__center - this class is used for the caption itself.

pswp__caption__title and pswp__caption__desc - these classes are used, if the caption is divided into a title an description (based on the data-caption-title and data-caption-desc attributes in the image link).

pswp__description - this class is used for the description if this is displayed in addition to the regular caption.

pswp__caption__exif - this class is used for the EXIF data DIV element.

pswp__caption__exif_focal, pswp__caption__exif_fstop, pswp__caption__exif_shutter, pswp__caption__exif_iso, pswp__caption__exif_datetime - these classes are used for the individual properties in the EXIF data.

= Why is there no "zoom animation" when opening the lightbox? =

PhotoSwipe has the option to create a zoom animation from the thumbnail to the final image when opening the lightbox. However, this does not work well with square thumbnails since the thumbnail is just enlarged to the final image size without keeping its aspect ratio. This would result in a quite weird image display where a square thumbnail gets stretched to a portrait or landscape image before the final image is loaded. Just having a black background where the final image gets loaded seems to be the better solution. Also see [http://photoswipe.com/documentation/faq.html](http://photoswipe.com/documentation/faq.html) about this topic.

= Conflict with Advanced Gutenberg =

Lightbox with PhotoSwipe works fine with Gutenberg gallery blocks as well. However when you use the "Advanced Gutenberg" plugin it brings its own lightbox script which can cause conflicts. To avoid any problems, you should disable the Advanced Gutenberg lightbox in the settings. Disable the option "Open galleries in lightbox" in the backend configuration of Advanced Gutenberg.

= Local changes in PhotoSwipe =

The following changes are the differences to PhotoSwipe 4.0 as of 2020-04-14:

1) The default UI is based on a CSS file and a number of graphics in different formats. This CSS file got modified to provide a fix for WordPress themes which use elements with a quite high Z index which hide the controls of PhotoSwipe. By setting the Z index of the affected controls to the highest possible value, all controls stay visible in front.

2) There are four skins, which you can choose from. Every skin is based on the default UI with some modifications. "New share symbol" contains a modified "share" symbol while "solid" in the name indicates, that all controls have a solid background instead of a slight transparency.

3) When dragging the picture to the top, there is no additional fade out animation when closing the picture.

4) When looping is disabled, this also applies to the desktop view.

5) The grey placeholder for images when opening the lightbox is not visible (this was accomplished by adding `display: none;` for the placeholder).

6) Arrows for next and previous picture will be hidden for the first or last picture if no endless loop is activated.

7) When using full picture size in desktop view the UI elements will hide automatically and not only after a mouse movement and the image caption will also be hidden together with the navigation.

8) Full screen mode can also be activated by pressing the key "F" on the keyboard.

9) Gallery items support an optional "exif" property to display EXIF information in addition to the caption.

10) Infinite loop is also possible with only two images.

11) Added slide animation for changing images using the arrow buttons or via keyboard as suggested in [https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe/pull/1179](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe/pull/1179).

12) Added options to use the mouse wheel for zooming or switching images in desktop view.

13) Added option to add "onclick" handlers for sharing links

14) Added option to add a custom url for sharing links

= Licensing =

To avoid any confusion: this plugin was published with the agreement of Dmitry Semenov.
