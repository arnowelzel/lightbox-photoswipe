Integration of PhotoSwipe (http://photoswipe.com) for WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin is a simple integration of PhotoSwipe to WordPress. All linked images in a post or page will be displayed using PhotoSwipe, regardless if they are part of a gallery or single images. Just make sure that you link the image or gallery directly to the media and not the attachment page (in galleries the option `link=file` should be set).

More about PhotoSwipe see here: http://photoswipe.com

== Installation ==

1. Extract the contents of the package to the `/wp-content/plugins/lightbox-photoswipe` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Using the plugin =

All linked images in a post or page will be displayed using PhotoSwipe, regardless if they are part of a gallery or single images.

Make sure that you link the image or gallery directly to the media and not the attachment page (in galleries the option `link=file` should be set).

= Experimental feature: return to a specific URL when closing the lightbox =

Note: this was changed with version 2.0. The previous parameter `return` is no longer supported.

When you activate the setting for "Activate browser history" you can link directly to an image inside a page or post:

`http://domain.example/example-page#gid=1&pid=1`

This will load the given page/post and automatically open the first image (`pid=1`) in the lightbox. However, when closing the lightbox, you will see the page or post itself. Sometimes it is preferred to go to a specific URL when closing the lightbox. This can be done by using `returnurl` combined with the URL to got to as the first parameter:

`http://domain.example/example-page#returnurl=http://domain.example&gid=1&pid=1`

When a visitor now opens the link, closing the lightbox will get the visitor to specified URL `http://domain.example`.

= How to disable the plugin in certain pages/posts =

Please note: the order of the parameters have changed in version 1.90.

Some other plugins use PhotoSwipe as well and there may be a conflict - for example with the product pages of WooCommerce.

You can either configure the pages/posts manually in the settings or you can use the filter `lbwps_enabled`. This filter gets the ID of the current page/post and if the lightbox is currently enabled (`true` or `false`). If the filter returns `true`, the lightbox will be used, if it returns `false` the lightbox will be disabled - which means, no scripts and stylesheets will be included at all on the current page/post.

Example:

`
// Disable Lightbox with PhotoSwipe on WooCommerce product pages

function my_lbwps_enabled($enabled, $id)
{
    if (function_exists('is_product')) {
        if (is_product()) return false;
    }

    return $enabled;
}

add_filter('lbwps_enabled', 'my_lbwps_enabled', 10, 2);
`

= How to modify the PhotoSwipe markup =

If you want to modify the existing PhotoSwipe markup, you can use the filter `lbwps_markup`. This filter gets one parameter with the existing markup and must return the modified markup to be used.

A "quick & dirty" example to add additional stuff in the header with the controls (CSS should never be inline - this is just to get a working example):

`function my_lbwps_markup($markup)
{
    // Add some additional elements
    $markup = str_replace(
        '<div class="pswp__top-bar">',
        '<div class="pswp__top-bar"><div style="position:absolute; width:100%; text-align:center; line-height:44px; font-size:13px; color:#fff; opacity: 0.75;">Our content</div>',
        $markup
	);
    return $markup;
}

add_filter('lbwps_markup', 'my_lbwps_markup', 10, 1);`

= Why is there no "zoom animation" when opening the lightbox? =

PhotoSwipe has the option to create a zoom animation from the thumbnail to the final image when opening the lightbox. However, this does not work well with square thumbnails since the thumbnail is just enlarged to the final image size without keeping its aspect ratio. This would result in a quite weird image display where a square thumbnail gets stretched to a portrait or landscape image before the final image is loaded. Just having a black background where the final image gets loaded seems to be the better solution. Also see http://photoswipe.com/documentation/faq.html about this topic.

= Conflict with Advanced Gutenberg =

Lightbox with PhotoSwipe works fine with Gutenberg gallery blocks as well. However when you use the "Advanced Gutenberg" plugin it brings its own lightbox script which can cause conflicts. To avoid any problems, you should disable the Advanced Gutenberg lightbox in the settings. Disable the option "Open galleries in lightbox" in the backend configuration of Advanced Gutenberg.

= Local changes in PhotoSwipe =

The following changes are the differences to PhotoSwipe 4.0 as of 2018-11-08:

1) The default UI is based on a CSS file and a number of graphics in different formats. This CSS file got modified to provide a fix for WordPress themes which use elements with a quite high Z index which hide the controls of PhotoSwipe. By setting the Z index of the affected controls to the highest possible value, all controls stay visible in front.

2) There are four skins, which you can choose from. Every skin is based on the default UI with some modifications. "New share symbol" contains a modified "share" symbol while "solid" in the name indicates, that all controls have a solid background instead of a slight transparency.

3) When dragging the picture to the top, there is no additional fade out animation when closing the picture.

4) When looping is disabled, this also applies to the desktop view.

5) The grey placeholder for images when opening the lightbox is not visible (this was accomplished by adding `display: none;` for the placeholder).

= Licensing =

To avoid any confusion: this plugin was published with the agreement of Dmitry Semenov.
