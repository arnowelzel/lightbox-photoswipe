# Lightbox with PhotoSwipe

This plugin integrates an extended version of PhotoSwipe 4 or the official release of PhotoSwipe 5 to WordPress.

More about PhotoSwipe see here: [http://photoswipe.com](http://photoswipe.com)

For more information about how to install Lightbox with PhotoSwipe see the [WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lightbox-photoswipe/).

## Custom styles for PhotoSwipe 5

Please note that this plugin uses a custom stylesheet for the frontend (see `assets/ps5/lib/photoswipe-local.css`).
This style is based on the original stylesheet of PhotoSwipe 5 and contains the following changes:


* Keep UI elements clickable when hidden - this was the behaviour of PhotoSwipe 4 and avoids
  confusion when the UI hides automatically in desktop mode and clicking the hidden arrow
  would then close the lightbox instead of changing to the next image.
* Make sure that UI elements are hidden even when the mouse is hovering them in desktop mode.

## Building minified versions of scripts and styles

If you want to change any of the scripts or styles you need to update the minified versions of them.

The plugin comes with a minifier script using PHP. To run that script use the following command:

```
php build.php
```

You should then see an output like this:

```
