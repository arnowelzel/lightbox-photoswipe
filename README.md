# Lightbox with PhotoSwipe

This plugin integrates an extended version of PhotoSwipe 4 or the official release of PhotoSwipe 5 to WordPress.

More about the original version of PhotoSwipe see here: [http://photoswipe.com](http://photoswipe.com)

For more information about how to install and use see the [WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lightbox-photoswipe/).

## Building minified versions of scripts and styles

If you want to change any of the scripts or styles you need to update the minified versions of them.

The plugin comes with a minifier script using PHP. To run that script use the following command:

```
php build.php
```

You should then see an output like this:

```
Building frontend script (PhotoSwipe 4)
Building frontend scripts (PhotoSwipe 5)
Building style for PhotoSwipe 4 skin classic
Building style for PhotoSwipe 4 skin classic-solid
Building style for PhotoSwipe 4 skin default

```
